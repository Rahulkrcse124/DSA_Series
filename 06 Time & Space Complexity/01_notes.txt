there are 3 types of time complexity
   1: worth case: more the operation perform in the case (n operation)
     denote Big O : represent O(n)
   2: best case: most less operation perform in the case (1 operation)
   3: average case: average operation perform in the case (n operation)

    * if any operation takes the time more than 1second then occured error tle(time limit exceeded)



space complexity: 
    extra memory space take by an algorithm for input size
